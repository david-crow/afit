In this research, we attempt to solve a multi-domain optimization problem using various algorithmic techniques. Specifically, we utilize different deterministic, stochastic, and local search algorithms to maximize \ac{uav} surveillance coverage and minimize the risk of detection for each \ac{uav}. We formally describe the problem's domain before following the algorithm domain design process to refine each search algorithm from problem domain to implemented code. After doing so, we evaluate the software implementations and present the experimental results obtained for different problem instances. Finally, we discuss variations on these algorithms and other potential techniques for solving this optimization problem.
