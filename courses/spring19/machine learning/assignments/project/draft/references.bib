    abstract = {Security professionals are interested in knowing with a high level of confidence the details of each flight beyond what the self-broadcasted data provides. A program run by the Air Force is attempting to better characterize flights. From various data sources, this program attempts to determine aircraft identities. The purpose of this study is to test unsupervised machine learning methods to improve the Air Force's aircraft identification process. These alternative methods cluster unlabeled aircraft flight data from which we identify different aircraft types and maneuvers. The alternate methods include k-means and k-medoids. To improve the clustering, we first perform feature engineering. Some of the features built include acceleration rates, G forces, specific excess power, flight path angle, flight efficiency, and winding number. We then cluster the data using the above features and determine the ideal number of clusters via the average silhouette width. The initial clusters identify discrete flight maneuvers, such as takeoff and landing, and from these initial clusters we utilize sub-clustering to identify aircraft. To validate our aircraft identification process, we implement web scraping to develop a labeled dataset to compare the distribution of aircraft within the sub-cluster versus the initial cluster. The final model uses k-means, and 12 of the 14 sub-clusters generated by it have statistically different distributions of aircraft at $\alpha$ = 0.01 from the initial clusters. This indicates that we can better identify aircraft type given in which sub-cluster a data point resides. With some modifications, the method could be used by the Air Force to augment the current identification process.},

    abstract = {The goal of this paper is to consider, formulate, and solve prediction problems encountered in tactical air combat. The problem involves prediction and identification of continuous-trajectory air combat maneuvers where only partial/incomplete information is given. This problem is solved using a qualitative representation of the maneuvers and their implementation as a neural network. We have broken our central dynamical problem down into several smaller subproblems ("eigencurves"), which describe the states of a continuous-trajectory dynamic system. We find that the resulting sequences of vectors uniquely express the time evolution of interacting dynamic objects. This method has been used to describe the forms of relationships between accelerations and velocities (not the values themselves.) All possible modes of a system can be identified while offering a complete parametrization of all possible tactical maneuvers. Additional information can be used to establish which of the several alternative behaviors will actually take place. These sequences serve as the symbolic input to the artificial neural network we have provided. We found that due to high correlation of input data, a single hidden layer could not satisfactorily distinguish (with at least 55-85{\%} accuracy) simple one-on-one maneuvers, such as the Turn-In, from more complex two-on-one maneuvers; for this reason, two hidden layers were incorporated. For each layer, many different architectures and learning rules were tested; the network described here gives the best results (55-95{\%} accuracy for partial information). Thus, we found that the neural network implementation provided a high-speed, fault-tolerant, and robust computational cell for the identification of tactical maneuvers and suggestions for a best countermaneuver. We note that, for the sake of completeness, we include considerable background material about neural networks also.},

    abstract = {This paper reports on a project where a genetics-based machine learning system acquired rules for novel fighter combat maneuvers through simulation. In this project, a genetic machine learning system was implemented to generate high angle-of-attack air combat tactics for the NASA X-31 research aircraft. The Genetic Learning System (GLS), based on a learning classifier system approach, employed a digital simulation model of one on one air combat and a Genetic Algorithm to develop effective tactics for the X-31. The resulting maneuvers allowed the X-31 to successfully exploit its post-stall capabilities against a conventional fighter opponent, demonstrating the ability of the GLS to discover novel tactics in a dynamic air combat environment. Moreover, the project demonstrates how genetic machine learning can acquire rules that implement novel approaches to unforeseen problems via experience with simulations.},

    abstract = {Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data.These tools can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Broadly speaking, supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model for pre- dicting, or estimating, an output basedonone or more inputs.Problems of this nature occur in fields as diverse as business, medicine, astrophysics, and public policy. With unsupervised statistical learning, there are inputs but no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and struc- ture from such data. To provide an illustration of some applications of statistical learning, we briefly discuss three real-world data sets that are considered in this book.},
