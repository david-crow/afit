Often, flying organizations require accurate information about what their airplanes are doing. Applying labels to various maneuvers, however, is a nontrivial task. In this research, we utilize a flight simulator to generate data about an aircraft's orientation, altitude, airspeed, vertical velocity, and acceleration as the values change over time. Both an expert system and a non-expert human label each datapoint with a flight maneuver. We then fit machine learning models to the human's labels to determine whether the non-expert applies the same labels as the expert system. If the expert system's labels are significantly different from those of the best possible model, then we know that the layman-applied labels are not reliable. However, even if the non-expert's labels are unreliable, a demonstrated ability to fit a model to the labels may indicate an ability to replace expert labelers with models fit to the experts, thus saving hours of manpower.
